This codebook describes the variables and any transformations that have been made to make the data tidy.
There are altogether 88 variables in this data set. Of these, two - Activity and SubjectId are the identification variables and the remaining 86 are measure variables. All the values for the measure variables denote the average value of that measure for each pair of activity and subject.
The variable, Activity, can take one of six values - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING AND LAYING. 
Altogether the obervations were made on 30 individuals, each denoted by sequential numbers.
Of the 86 measure variables, 40 denote the average of observations regarding the mean and standard deviation of various time domain signals. 
About 39 denote the average of observations regarding the mean and standard deviations of various frequency domain signals.
The remaining 7 measure variables the average of the angle observations between various mean observations. 
The variable names have been chosen to be Camel Case and provide a clearer explanation of what each variable represents. 
It is to be remembered that all measure variables are average values - summarized from the initial raw data.
